**Statistical and computational methods for high-throughput genomics.**  
_Interactive data analysis. Metagenomics. Cancer epigenomics. Transcriptomics._

### What we work on

Our research focuses on efficient and effective interactive analysis of high-throughput genomic data. We develop new methods and tools from multiple areas in the computational and statistical sciences: basic bioinformatics/biostatistics, statistical and machine learning, data visualization and management, and numerical optimization. Applications include cancer epigenetics, metagenomics, pre-processing of measurements from high-throughput assays and disease risk models that integrate high-throughput genomic and other data.
