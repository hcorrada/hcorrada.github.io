####Second-generation sequencing data quality assessment and analysis 
Simple models of intensity measurements in second-generation sequencing data give easily interpretable quality
assessment metrics while capturing uncertainty in base-calling and
    mapping. Applications to variant calling in pooled resequencing experiments.

####Estimating Tree-Structured Covariance Matrices via Mixed Integer Programming
A novel method for estimating tree-structured covariance matrices directly from observed continuous data.

-H. Corrada Bravo, S. Wright, K. H. Eng, S. Keles and
  G. Wahba. "Estimating Tree-Structured Covariance Matrices via
  Mixed-Integer Programming." _Journal of Machine Learning Research

- We use the mixed-integer solver in
  [CPLEX](http://www.ilog.com/products/cplex/) in this project. We
  have written an R interface to CPLEX (Linux and Windows) available
  [in CRAN]("http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcplex/)
